# Reduced Loot

Reduced Loot is a gameplay mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studios

It aims to increase difficulty across all experience modes, by reducing the amount of certain types of items throughout the game world. It works by 
despawning these items, by chance, upon entering a new scene for the first time. Values are adjustable in the Mod Settings menu. 

If an item doesn't despawn, there is a chance it's condition can be reduced from the normal values, especially on tools. 

These items include:
* Hatchet
* Knife
* Prybar
* Hacksaw
* Hammer
* Bedroll
* Revolver
* Rifle
* Flare gun
* Revolver & Rifle ammo
* Bow and arrows
* Red Flares
* MRE
* Energy Bars
* Simple & Quality tools
* Flight jacket, aviator cap, expedition parka, wool clothing, fisherman's sweater, etc...
* Matches
* Accelerant
* Antiseptic
* Painkillers & Antibiotics
* Emergency Stim
* Coffee Tin
* Coffee Cup
* Herbal Tea package
* Oats
* Insulated Flask
* Spray Paint

These items may be much harder to come across as you progress through the game world. But nothing is guaranteed as it is based on chance.
